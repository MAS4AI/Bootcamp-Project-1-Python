# RPG Game Setup

This is a text-based RPG game setup script where you can choose a map, modify your gears (weapon and armor), invite a friend, and play the game. The script is written in Python.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

## Concepts and Data Types Used

This RPG game setup script demonstrates the use of various concepts and data types in Python:

- **Functions**: The script utilizes functions to encapsulate and organize different functionalities of the game, such as choosing a map, modifying gears, inviting a friend, and playing the game.

- **Conditions**: Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are used to handle different cases and validate user input throughout the script. It ensures that the program executes the appropriate code based on the user's choices.

- **Loops**: The script includes a `while` loop that allows the user to navigate through the game's menu and make multiple selections until they choose to exit the game.

- **Lists and Dictionaries**: The game setup involves the use of lists and dictionaries to store and manage data. Lists are used to store available maps, weapons, armor sets, and friends. Dictionaries are used to associate attributes such as DPS (Damage Per Second) for weapons and durability for armor sets.

- **Lambda Function**: A lambda function (`DPS_buff`) is used to calculate the buffed DPS value for the chosen weapon. It multiplies the base DPS value of the weapon by a constant factor to apply the buff.

- **User Input and Output**: The script uses `input()` function to prompt the user for input and `print()` function to display information and messages to the user during the gameplay.

These concepts and data types collectively create an interactive RPG game setup that allows players to customize their gears, choose a map, invite friends, and embark on their adventure.
